# InterviewPrep is my entire I am using to prepare for tech jobs, this is for developers who went to academia for a while and are looking to reskill or upskill for the industry. There are two main folders here, the leetcode part and then the react-apps folder. 

## LeetCode
This contains all LeetCode problems and will be broken down into different folders based on data structure, and difficulty level. I will try to leave as much comments as possible in my codes to make it easier for others to understand. I might also include a folder for company specific problems I have solved. This won't be your only resource as you will need to actually read documentations and do your own practice, but this should be a good blueprint to get you feeling confident. 
- Programming Language: Python (it's easy for solving problems man, what can I say?)
- Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs,

## React_apps
I haven't done a lot of complex react apps in a minute because I have been focusing on quanutm computing and IoT security but I'm back at it again boii lol. Each project I will solve will have a reason behind it, it is all to learn something or improve on something. I will also try to document my process as much as possible. Each project will have its own README that will contain details on why I used certain programming techniques, what it is teaching you and how to improve on it.

Stay tuned for more updates, I intend to put a backend folder here as well, so you can also learn how to create solid backend systems. My main stack is React x Django, so if it's not yours, I will encourage you to create the same projects in your programming language of choice.

### Happy coding!!!!
